  <h1 class = "about_title">About Rotator</h1>
  <p class = "about_p">Rotator is an organizational app created to help college students with the fair share of tasks in the household.
    The app was created as a result of our own personal experience of living at university halls, and having to cope with some people doing all the house chores, while others did nothing.
    The structure of the app consists of various groups which are formed depending upong the people living in the flat. </p>
  <p class = "about_p">Each flat has a set of tasks which each user can add to the database.
    When a task is added to the list of tasks, it will become part of the schedule the following week and the task will be assigned to a random member of the group (flat).
    Tasks have a set time to be completed. Once so, another user from the same group has to verify that task was completed accordingly by clicking on the "verify" button in the app.
  </p>
</br>
  <p class= "about_p"> Rotator was made as part of a first year group project at the University of Manchester. The team is listed below.
    Additional thanks go to our tutor, UIi Sattler, as well as all the staff in the School of Computer Science. </p>
